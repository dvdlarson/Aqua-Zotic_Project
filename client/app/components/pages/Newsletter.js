                  <h4><strong>Pacific Fish Have Gotten Smaller</strong></h4>
                  <p>by Liz Osborn CurrentResults.com</p>

                  <p class="quote">The size of fish living near the ocean floor along the Pacific coast of the United States has declined dramatically in two decades.
      Between 1980 and 2001, the average weight of rockfish, flatfish and skates dropped by nearly half.
      Flatfish, including sole, netted off the coast of California, Oregon and Washington in 2001 typically weighed in only 57% as heavy as the average flatfish caught in 1980. Cartilaginous fish such as skate caught in 2001 averaged two-thirds (67%) the weight of those landed in 1980.
These size decreases don't entirely account for the overall 45% reduction in the average weight of bottom-dwelling fish. The shrinking is also due to larger species of fish becoming much less prevalent.</p>

                  <p>Populations of the bigger rockfish species dropped by 5 to 17% a year between 1977 and 2001. For two species, the declines are particularly alarming. After 1977, numbers of canary rockfish along the US west coast plummeted by 85% and boccacio rockfish by 96%.At the same time, populations have actually increased for most of the 31 groundfish species studied by scientists from the Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle. Cartilaginous fish doubled in number between 1977 and 2001. Flatfish became eight times more plentiful during the same period. Small species of rockfish, such as greenstripped and splitnose, experienced similar population growth, generally increasing over 6% annually.
The species in decline can be distinguished by their life histories. They are generally long-lived fish, that grow large and reproduce slowly. </p>

                  <p>The radically different population trends among species have overturned the Pacific Ocean's bottom-dwelling fish communities. Rockfish have gone from making up 60% of the fish caught in 1977 surveys to only 17% in 2001. Flatfish that used to make up 34% of catches, more recently comprise 80% of the fish netted. Flatfish have overtaken rockfish to become the dominant type of fish living near the US Pacific coast seabed.
      s restructured the mix of these west coast fish. But declines in the later-maturing rockfish are greater than can be attributed to fishing alone. The flip in fish communities may have created conditions where canary and boccacio rockfish can no longer thrive.
What's most disturbing about these results, the authors of this study point out, is the revelation that even after fishing is curtailed, long-lived species may never recover from heavy harvesting.</p>

                  <h4><strong>Scientists Claim Fish 'Talk' to Each Other</strong></h4>

                  <p>by Paul Chapman in Wellington</p>

                  <p class="quote">Fish communicate with each other in a secret language of grunts, growls, chirps and pops, researchers in New Zealand have discovered. Far from being a place of deep silence, the underwater world is abuzz with the sound of fish sweet-talking the opposite sex, warning others of danger, giving directions, and general background chatter.
                  Predators may even hunt out prey by intercepting fish talk, researcher Shahriman Ghazali of Auckland University said.
                  "All fish can hear but not all can make sound -- pops and other sounds made by vibrating their swim bladder, a muscle they can contract," he said.
                  Mr. Ghazali, who is presenting a paper on his research to fellow marine scientists in Wellington this week, hopes to decipher the contexts for different types of communication.
</p>

                  <p>"This is the next step. We are 99 per cent sure they are fish sounds.
                  "Now we want to find out what the sounds mean," he told the New Zealand Herald.
                  The main reasons appear to be attracting mates, scaring off predators, and orientating themselves around reefs, he said.
                  He placed groups of fish into tanks in a laboratory, gave them a few weeks to settle in, and monitored them using an underwater microphone and instruments that detect water movement.
                  It emerged that gurnard are among the most talkative, making distinctive grunts and keeping up a pattern of chatter throughout the day.
                  Cod, on the other hand, stay mostly silent, except while spawning when they become very vocal.
</p>

                  <p>"The hypothesis is that they are using the sound as a synchronization so that the male and female release their eggs at the same time for fertilization," Mr. Ghazali said.
                  "Outside spawning season, you won't hear a sound from them."
                  Fish known as bigeyes produce a popping sound, which appears to operate as a sort of Morse code.
                  Mr. Ghazali debunked a commonly held belief that crayfish in New Zealand waters make a similar popping sound when divers approach.
                  "I didn't get any sound from any of them," he said.
                  He also advised pet owners who tap the bowls of goldfish not to hold their breath for a reply.
                  "Goldfish have excellent hearing but they don't make any sound whatsoever," he said.

                  <h4><strong>Exotic Species Endanger Native Fish</strong></h4>
                  <p>by Liz Osborn CurrentResults.com</p>
                  <p class="quote">
                        Non-native fish are already implicated in the extinctions of five fish species in Canada and they threaten the continued existence of many others.
                        Invasive species jeopardize 26 of the freshwater fish species, sub-species and isolated populations considered by the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Canada (COSEWIC) in 2003 as endangered or threatened.
Usually several factors in unison contribute to the declining numbers of fish at risk. Loss and degradation of wetlands, lakes and rivers are certainly the most widespread problems. Invasive species pose the second most prevalent peril.</p>

                  <p>Nation-wide, natural fish populations are being harmed by fifteen species of invasive fish, particularly pumpkinseed, sea lamprey, alewife and black spotted goby. Most of these fish were introduced into Canadian waters without sanction in attempts to improve sport fishing. Besides exotic fish, the aquatic plants Eurasian watermilfoil and reed-canary grass are also devastating for some local species.
      Introduced animals and plants have made the greatest dent in native fish biodiversity within watersheds of the Great Lakes and upper St. Lawrence River, and on Pacific islands off the coast of British Columbia.
One widespread menace, rainbow smelt, got its start in 1912 when it was released into Crystal Lake to help feed trout. Smelts rapidly moved into all the Great Lakes and hundreds of smaller lakes in central Canada, aided by anglers using the fish as bait. They have already propelled blue pike to extinction and now threaten four other native species.</p>

                  <p>Brown bullhead, a type of catfish, is one of the worst offenders, affecting nine native species. Within years, bullheads gobbling up enough eggs to wipe out two stickleback species unique to Hadley Lake on Lasqueti Island in BC. The ongoing spread of brown bullheads seems to make extinction inevitable for four more stickleback species on nearby Texada Island, and two in Enos Lake on Vancouver Island.
      In addition to the sticklebacks, native fish which are particularly struggling against the consequences of introductions are pugnose shiner, Cultus pygmy sculpin, Lake Utopia dwarf smelt, and deepwater sculpin in the Great Lakes. Invasive species have also furthered declines of the endangered Salish sucker, northern madtom, Atlantic whitefish, Cultus sockeye salmon, and Atlantic salmon of the inner Bay of Fundy. Some of these fish are unsuccessfully coping with more than one exotic species.
