            <p>All about the fish and how awesome they are.</p>

            <p>Then we talk about fish we know that fish live in the salted water which is located mostly in the oceans on the planet.
            I believe that the fish might live for a while because of how they get their food to their babies that they produce.
            There are so many different types of fish that live in the ocean and some of the fish can be deadly to humans and
            some of them can be nice to humans for eample: small fish and dolphins and they can swim right next to you when you
            are in the water. The deadliest fish the live in the ocean is sharks and whales. sharks can be deadly around humans
            because they have sharp teeth that can bite a whole arm off someones body with speed. When someone's blood hits the
            ocean water then the shark can smell it from miles way and that is pretty crazy. When the blood goes into the shark's
            nose then the eyes turns black and the person should get out of the water quickly before the shark gets into the
            area. The whale is different from other fish including sharks because of their size. The whales are the biggest
            creatures in the world because they can group up to 80 to 100 feet in length and weight between 70 to 100 tons. The
            food that whales eat can be anything from fish to squid to human. The whale can swallow anything in its path, it can
            eat a human in one bite. There are different types of whales and they are: a blue whale, humback whale, and a grey
            whale. There are different types of sharks and they are: The great white shark, Hammerhead Shark, tiger shark. The
            great white sharks are the king of sharks because they are really deadly. The small fish are usually found at a store
            or at the aquraim. Another deadly fish that lives in the ocean is called a squid. Sometimes there are jellyfish that
            live in the ocean they can be deadly as well because of their stingers. Usually the jellyfish can grow up to 120
            feet in length which is really long by my standards.</p>

            <p>I believe that there are so many different types of species in the ocean and that is the true most of those species
            can survive in really bad weather cases. There are some fish that live near the bottom of the ocean where it is really
            dark that you can not see anything infront of your face. But there is one fish that you need to be carefull with and
            that is the one that has a bulb that is hanging from the head of the fish. The teeth are so big that they can cut
            through your skin as if it was a knife.</p>
